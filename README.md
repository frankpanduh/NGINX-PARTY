# NGINX Media+QUIC Build

**Purpose:**  
Automated build of **NGINX** with media-rich features: QUIC / HTTP/3, Brotli, HTTP/2, RTMP streaming, AVIF/WebP support, and strong security defaults.

**Why this exists:**  
Cloudflare handles QUIC at the edge, but no one provides an easy **community build** for media-rich NGINX on Ubuntu 24.04. This fills that gap hopefully...
